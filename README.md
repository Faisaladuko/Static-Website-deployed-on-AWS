# Static-Website-deployed-on-AWS
Static Travel Website Deployed On Amazon Web Services


The cloud is perfect for hosting static websites that only include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that require no server-side processing. In this project, you will deploy a static website to AWS.

First, I created an S3 bucket, configure the bucket for website hosting, and secure it using IAM policies.

Next, I uploaded the website files to my bucket and speed up content delivery using AWSâ€™s content distribution network service, CloudFront.

Lastly, I accessed my website in a browser using the unique S3 endpoint.

I took screenshots of the results of each of my steps in a zipped folder.

The zipped folder contains a README.txt file which includes my website's URL.
